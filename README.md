## Summary

Since there are so few participants in the vine program (who have provided helpful votes), there is bias present; The sample is not large enough to draw a firm conclusion. Another test that could be done would to be to focus on the "most helpful" votes (i.e. where helpful votes / total votes is around 70%. This way, we could focus on those reviewers who are the most reliable.
